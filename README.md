# Gym Stars

Gym Start is about embracing a new lifestyle with effective exercise and healthy nutrition. Gym Stars aim to accomplish any goals, from gaining muscle, weight loss or simply being fit.

## Features

- __Navigation Bar__

Featured on all the pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Programs page, About and contact page and it is identical in each page. When the user hovers over the links the line underneath the text is white and it will stay red when the user is on the page.
Clicking on the logo would bring the user to the home page.
This feature allows the user to navigate between the different pages without having to press the browsers back or forward navigation.

- __The Main Image__

The main image of the website represents a female athlete training under the assistance of one of the personal trainers with the motivational quote right at the center of the image. 
The image zooms in everytime the page is opened.

The ‘Why Gym Stars’ is a first introduction of the website giving  the user a reason to get interested about it.
A ‘Programs’ button will take the user to see the programmes Gym Stars offers.

- __The Map__

I placed a Map showing the address to the user.

- __The Footer__

The footer includes links to social media sites and the copyright for the website. I added Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the user to interact with the posts uploaded by Gym Stars, and You Tube for the user to have a look of the workout videos. The links will open to a new tab for easier navigation. 
I have added the noopener value to all links for a safer navigation.

## Testing

### Validators:

#### HTML:
* [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

* The validator revealed 4 errors and 2 warnings in the index.html, 3 errors in the program.html, 3 errors in the about.html and 2 errors in the contact.html.

#### CSS:
* [W3C jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* The validator revealed 1 error.

### Fixing error and warning

* All errors and warnings have been fixed except 1 error in the index.html. The value for width of the Map has a '%' which I find to be useful for a better adaptation on different screen sizes. It also worked on the 'Love Running' project.
