## Design

### Design Choices
I gave the website a design that wants to look modern, tidy and eye-pleasing to the users being easy to navigate.

### Colour
I have given the website a contrast of shades of gray, black and shades of orange as a light orange color as background for some texts and an orangered, a dark orange color for borders and buttons. I choose the orange because from a marketing point of view it is seen as healthy, energized and attention grabbing.

### Fonts
Oswald was used for the logo and the headings and Roboto for the paragraphs. I chose these fonts because they are considered attractive and amenable. 

### Structure
The page is structured in an easy user friendly way. Upon arriving at the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the gym logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right.
The website consists of four separate pages:
- A homepage with a hero image, a welcome section and the location of the gym.
- A programme page with the training programmes offered.
- An about page with the ‘Why Gym Stars’.
- A contact page with a contact form to ask questions or leave a message.

## Features

- __Navigation Bar__
 
Featured on all the pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Programs page, About and contact page and it is identical in each page. When the user hovers over the links the line underneath the text is white and it will stay red when the user is on the page.
Clicking on the logo would bring the user to the home page.
This feature allows the user to navigate between the different pages without having to press the browsers back or forward navigation.

The main image of the website represents a female athlete training under the assistance of one of the personal trainers with the motivational quote right at the center of the image.
The image zooms in everytime the page is opened.

- __The Footer__
 
The footer includes links to social media sites and the copyright for the website. I added Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the user to interact with the posts uploaded by Gym Stars, and You Tube for the user to have a look of the workout videos. The links will open to a new tab for easier navigation.
I have added the noopener value to all links for a safer navigation.
