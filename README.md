## Design

### Design Choices
I gave the website a design that wants to look modern, tidy and eye-pleasing to the users being easy to navigate.

### Colour
I have given the website a contrast of shades of gray, black and shades of orange as a light orange color as background for some texts and an orangered, a dark orange color for borders and buttons. I choose the orange because from a marketing point of view it is seen as healthy, energized and attention grabbing.

### Fonts
Oswald was used for the logo and the headings and Roboto for the paragraphs. I chose these fonts because they are considered attractive and amenable. 

### Structure
The page is structured in an easy user friendly way. Upon arriving at the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the gym logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right.
The website consists of four separate pages:
- A homepage with a hero image, a welcome section and the location of the gym.
- A programme page with the training programmes offered.
- An about page with the ‘Why Gym Stars’.
- A contact page with a contact form to ask questions or leave a message.
